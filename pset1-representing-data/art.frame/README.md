# ðŸŽ¨ `art.frame`

## Problem to Solve

Youâ€™ve learned about data frames: objects for storing data in rows and columns. In a file called `art.R` in a folder called `art.frame`, practice using data frames to create your very own art in R.

## Background

Youâ€™ve learned how to create a data frame by reading data from a file. Turns out you can also create your own data frames from scratch, using a function called `data.frame`.

Per its documentation, data.frame can be provided any number of named arguments. Those argument names become the data frameâ€™s column names. Then, the values for each of those arguments become the given columnâ€™s values.

Take a look at how you could create a small, 3x3 data frame:

```R
data.frame(
  A = c("1", "2", "3"),
  B = c("4", "5", "6"),
  C = c("7", "8", "9")
)
```

Notice that there are 3 named arguments: A, B, and C. Each is passed a different valueâ€”a vector of 3 numbers!

The above code produces a data frame like the below:

<p align="center">
	<img src="dataframe-example.png" alt="dataframe-example" width="300"/>
</p>

Consider both widening and lengthening your data frame, as well as filling each column with a vector of empty spaces:

```R
data.frame(
  A = c(" ", " ", " ", " ", " "),
  B = c(" ", " ", " ", " ", " "),
  C = c(" ", " ", " ", " ", " "),
  D = c(" ", " ", " ", " ", " "),
  E = c(" ", " ", " ", " ", " ")
)
```
You now have a blank canvas with which to create your art!

## Distribution Code

For this problem, youâ€™ll need to create `art.R` in a folder called` art.frame`.

Open RStudio per the linked steps and navigate to the R console:

```R
>
```

Next execute

```R
getwd()
```

to print your working directory. Ensure your current working directory is where youâ€™d like to create this problemâ€™s folder. If using RStudio through `cs50.dev` the recommended directory is `/workspaces/NUMBER` where `NUMBER` is a number unique to your codespace.

If you do not see the right working directory, use setwd to change it! Try typing `setwd("..")` if in the working directory of another problem, which will move you one directory higher.

Next execute

```R
dir.create("art.frame")
```

in order to create a folder called art.frame in your codespace.

Now type

```R
setwd("art.frame")
```

followed by Enter to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory. Your working directory should now end with

```R
art.frame/
```

Finally, type

```R
file.create("art.R")
```

to create a file called `art.R` inside of the `art.frame` folder.

If all was successful, you should execute

```R
list.files()
```

and see `art.R`. If not, retrace your steps and see if you can determine where you went wrong!

To start on this problem, copy and paste the below code into `art.R`:

```R
art <- data.frame(
  A = c(" ", " ", " ", " ", " "),
  B = c(" ", " ", " ", " ", " "),
  C = c(" ", " ", " ", " ", " "),
  D = c(" ", " ", " ", " ", " "),
  E = c(" ", " ", " ", " ", " ")
)

print(art)
```

## Usage

Assuming `art.R` is in your working directory, enter the below in the R console to test your program:

```R
source("art.R")
```
