## Problem to Solve

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a method used by data scientists to find interesting characteristics of data and test hypotheses. It‚Äôs often one of the initial steps a researcher might take in a larger data analysis program.

You now have many of the tools you need to perform your own exploratory data analysis! In a program called `eda.R`, in a folder called `eda`, write a program to visualize and explore a data set of your choice.

## Specification

The only requirement for this problem is that you produce a visualization you care about, that is interesting to you, and that you feel proud of. Oh, and that you save the visualization in a file called `visualization.png`!
